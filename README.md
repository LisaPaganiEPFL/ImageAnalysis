## Repository content

- [`Membrane_Development.jar`](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/ImageAnalysis/blob/main/Membrane_Development.jar) final result to be used in combination with ImageJ.
- [`src`](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/ImageAnalysis/tree/main/src) folder contains all the classes used for the project.

## Classes

There are a total of 5 classes in the src folder. Here, there is a short description.

- [`Point3D.java`](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/ImageAnalysis/blob/main/src/Point3D.java) defines a 3D object with integer values. In this project is used for the volume pixel coordinates.
- [`Volume.java`](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/ImageAnalysis/blob/main/src/Volume.java) converts a ImagePlus image into an array.
- [ Apply_Transformation.java`] and [`Detect_Membrane.java`] are the PlugIn classes that exploit all the
